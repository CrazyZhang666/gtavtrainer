# GTA V Trainer
Trainer for GTA V Online

I am releasing this to the public because I am no longer proud of any of it and also GTA V sucks and is boring.


If I ever come back to this came im remaking the cheat. I cant look at this source anymore.

What is this menu?
  
-  Broken
-  Pasted
-  Garbage
-  Detected
-  Outdated
-  Messy
-  Abandoned
-  Stolen

What does it contain?

-  Updated variables for game build 2372
-  Everything provided in BigBaseV2-fix
-  Everything provided in Tecel007's "Salty" [https://github.com/tecel007/Salty]
-  Plenty of previously amazing kicks/crashes as well as prevention against them

Credits to:
- GitHub user Salty for original base
- GitHub user rotorbug for partnering
- GitHub user brobbins2001 for testing


Eventually I'm going to delete this so paste while you can.
