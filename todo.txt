charles shit to do and ideas for cagen landey :)
- figure out edit and continue (so we can make changes to the cheat without having to unload) and the performance profiler (improve the cheats performance with cpu times, memory, etc) since we can attach the msvc debugger to the game without it crashing
- fix the retarded spacing on the menu (im too lazy to redo the entire menu rn)
- put the fonts in byte arrays and then load the byte arrays with imgui (binary_to_compressed_c, or you can use HxD iirc)
- redo the retarded skeleton shit where i call storeSkeleton and connectSkeleton shit and replace it with a for loop

TODO SHORT TERM:

add recovery options for online (unlock all, upgrade all stats)
add default config option
add rig casino
render in d3d instead of in game
fix vehicle entity request bug
work on kick protection
cache multiplayer speed matrix for individual players


TODO LONG TERM:

learn more about proto events
